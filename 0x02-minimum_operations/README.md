For this task we are asked to calculate the minimum number of operations that need to be carried out to return  (n X) characters in a file. Oringinally the file contauns a single character (X) and our "Text Editor" can only execute only 2 operations (copy All, past). so using this two operations we should be able to visualize the process of how we got the result.

Solution:
To solve this problem i will be using a (Prime Factorization) technique to get the minimum number of operations
